h1. JPAdvertisement

JPAdvertisementBannerViewController is a near drop in replacement for ADBannerView. Meant as a local/cached version of iAds. Ads are loaded from self made .plist files, an example ad for Grades 2 http://gradesapp.com is included and used in the demo project.

h2. Use

To use JPAdvertisement copy the two classes from the folder JPAdvert. JPAdvertisementBannerViewController is the base class which handles displaying an advertisement as it is a view controller.

JPAdViewController is an empty subclass that exists for the sole purpose of shortening the class name to save typing. I recommend using this.

h2. Custom Ads

In order to load an ad from disk JPAdvertisement uses a plist, the name of which is passed to it via loadAdFromPlistNamed:. In that plist it looks for four keys; the adURL, affiliatedLink boolean, and file names of png images for landscape and portrait ads depending upon what device it is currently running on. 

Refactoring this to load external ads is a goal for the next major release, pending priorities.
