h1. JPAdvertisement

JPAdvertisementBannerViewController is a near drop in replacement for ADBannerView. Meant as a local/cached version of iAds. Ads are loaded from self made .plist files, an example ad for Grades 2 http://gradesapp.com is included and used in the demo project.

h2. Use

To use JPAdvertisement copy the JPAdvertisementBannerViewController class from the JPAdvert folder. Include in your Copy Bundle Resources the plist and image files for you advertisement.

Documentation is available at http://joepasq.com/documentation/jpadvertisement/

h2. Custom Ads

In order to load an ad from disk JPAdvertisement uses a plist, the name of which is passed to it via loadAdFromPlistNamed:. In that plist it looks for four keys; the adURL, affiliatedLink boolean, and file names of png images for landscape and portrait ads depending upon what device it is currently running on. See the Grades Sample Ad folder and mimic that to make your own ads.

Modifying this to download external ads is a goal for the next major release, pending priorities.
